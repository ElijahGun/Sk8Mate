PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:

>> Navbar -> login & register links should be on right side of page

>> Make sure that if someone deletes all pics the app wont crash
    options:
        -> make sure it will only delete if there is more than 1 left,
        -> If all is deleted, populate with default image
        -> other ideas

>> Seed with about 50 parks (not like 1000!) (optional scrollbar)

>> restyle Login & Register Pages

>> restyle detail page
    -> optional -> make add review on same page... (maybe good idea)

>> skateparks page 
    -> parks display should be more intuitive (not just a straight list!!!)

============================THOUGHTS===============================
-> I suck at CSS :( 

Options to finish this project:
-> Go study CSS and or bootstrap to make it work
-> Just copy Colt
-> Try yourself and when stuck, peek at colt's code

=======================DECISION=======================
-> DO NOT COPY!!! - that is not how learning happens!
-> Try to understand how this works and go implement it.
